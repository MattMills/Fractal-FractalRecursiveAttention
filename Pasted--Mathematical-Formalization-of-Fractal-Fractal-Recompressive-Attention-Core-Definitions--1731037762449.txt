# Mathematical Formalization of Fractal-Fractal Recompressive Attention

"""
Core Definitions:

Let A_n(X) be an attention operation at level n on vector space X
Let R_n(X) be a recompressive operation at level n
Let φ_n be the transformation function between levels
Let ∇_n be the geometric gradient operator at level n

Key Properties:
1. Self-Similarity: A_n ≅ A_{n+1} under φ_n
2. Recompressive Consistency: R_n ∘ R_{n+1} = R_{n+1} ∘ R_n
3. Attention Conservation: tr(A_n) = tr(A_{n+1}) under φ_n
4. Fractal Dimension: D = lim_{n→∞} log(N_n)/log(1/r_n)

"""
Key Theoretical Properties:

1. Recursive Consistency:
   ∀n: A_n ∘ R_n = R_n ∘ A_n

2. Information Conservation:
   I(A_n(X)) ≥ I(X) where I is information content

3. Dimensional Reduction:
   dim(R_n(X)) < dim(X) while preserving essential structure

4. Attention Flow:
   The gradient ∇A_n defines a vector field on the manifold
   that guides information flow between levels

5. Fractal Self-Similarity:
   For any level n, m:
   ∃φ: A_n ≅ A_m under transformation φ

6. Recompressive Equilibrium:
   lim_{n→∞} (R_n ∘ A_n)(X) converges to a stable point
   in the attention manifold
